# Java Edition Protocol Spec

This directory holds documentation for the [Minecraft Java Edition](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition) server/client networking protocol.

The aim is to provide docs for any given feature across various versions of the game (from Alpha to now), rather than just documenting the latest features in the latest version of the game.

You can also find documentation for the Bedrock Edition [here](../bedrock).
